ckanext-intro - A quick interactive introduction to writing CKAN extensions
===========================================================================

This is a sample extension, intended as a quick and interactive introduction
to writing CKAN extensions. It was used in the CKAN workshop at OKCon 2013.

This does not go into as much details as the proper tutorials for writing
extensions. Developers willing to start writing CKAN extensions should use
those as they are they provide all necessary detail:

* Writing extensions tutorial:

    http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/tutorial.html

* Custom theming tutorial:

    http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/theming.html

    This is a work in progress, in the meantime provisional docs can be found
    here:

     http://docs.ckan.org/en/847-new-theming-docs/theming.html

* Example IDatasetForm:

Requisites
==========

* A running source CKAN 2.1 install (http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/install-from-source.html)
* A sysadmin user
* Some datasets created

Both last operations are described in http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/getting-started.html


Installation
============

Install the extension as usual, in you activated virtualenv::

   pip install -e 'git+https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-intro.git#egg=ckanext-intro'

If you want to jump straight away to the end result, just add the plugin to
your CKAN configuration file::

    ckan.plugins = intro_plugin

It is recommended though that you follow the individual steps as described in
the next section.

How it works
============

The repository contains a step-by-step process of building an extension. Each
step is contained in a single commit, and flagged with a git tag (``step1``,
``step2``, ...)

You can move between steps using the ``git checkout`` command. For example to
start on the first step::

    git checkout step1

To move to the next step::

    git checkout step2

And so on. Once on a particular step, you can see the description of the whole
step and the files changed using the ``git show`` command.

You can also browse the steps on GitHub:
